# Bank Account Database (Python + SQLite)

A tiny learning project that builds a **bank** database in SQLite from Python scripts, seeds sample data, and publishes both the DB file and a readable Markdown report.

- **Database file**: [Bank.db](./Bank.db)
- **Single-page logical view**: [Bank.md](./Bank.md) â€“ contains the ER diagram and table previews generated by CI.

---

## Quick start (local)

```bash
python createDB.py      # create tables
python InsertData.py    # insert sample data
python Queries.py       # print reports to the console
```

> Requires Python 3.x. No third-party packages are needed (uses the stdlib `sqlite3`).

---

## Repository layout

- `createDB.py` â€“ creates the schema (Customers, Accounts, Transactions).
- `InsertData.py` â€“ inserts the sample rows.
- `Queries.py` â€“ simple SELECT queries that print to stdout.
- `Bank.db` â€“ the generated SQLite database (committed by CI).
- `Bank.md` â€“ single-page report (Mermaid ER + table snapshots), auto-generated by CI.
- `.github/workflows/build-and-commit-db.yml` â€“ GitHub Actions workflow that builds `Bank.db` and `Bank.md`.

## Data model

See **[Bank.md](./Bank.md)** for the ER diagram and the current table contents (rendered on GitHub).  
That page is re-created on each CI run so it always reflects the latest data.

---

## GitHub Actions (CI)

This repository includes a workflow that:
1. Checks out the repo and sets up Python.
2. Runs `createDB.py` and `InsertData.py` to produce `Bank.db`.
3. Exports a single Markdown report **`Bank.md`** (Mermaid ER + `Customers`, `Accounts (with owner)`, `Transactions` tables).
4. Commits any changes back to the repository.

**How to run:** open the **Actions** tab â†’ select **Build & Commit Bank.db** â†’ **Run workflow**.

**Outputs:**
- `Bank.db` at the repo root (the SQLite database file).
- `Bank.md` with an ER diagram and table previews you can read right in GitHub.

## Example queries (from `Queries.py`)

```sql
-- All customers
SELECT * FROM Customers;

-- Accounts joined with owner name
SELECT Accounts.acc_id, Customers.name, Accounts.acc_type, Accounts.balance
FROM Accounts
JOIN Customers ON Accounts.cust_id = Customers.cust_id;

-- All transactions
SELECT * FROM Transactions;
```

Run them via `python Queries.py` to see formatted output.
